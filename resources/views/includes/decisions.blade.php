        <p>Learana analyzes content usage to help you understand learner engagement. We use this data to provide advice
            on ways to improve the learning experience. (Link to Analytics). We also use this information to automate
            common tasks like reminding students to watch videos and read articles that are in your course. Our goal is
            to give you an extra set of
            eyes and hands, so you can spend more time connecting with your students. (Link to Automated
