        <p class="lead">Frequently learners fail to complete self paced courses that consist of only
            recorded content and documents. Learners are more more likely to complete online courses when
            they are led by a knowledgeable and motivated educator. Our platform connects popular tools used
            to teach online through chat, webinars, and other tools that help you connect with your
            students. (Link to tools)

            We create personalized reminders for learners based on their engagement with course content.
            These reminders help learners make more informed decisions about their education. We help
            students understand how long it will take them to complete course content and how they compare
            to others.</p>
